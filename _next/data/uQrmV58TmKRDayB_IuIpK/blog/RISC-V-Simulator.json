To utilize the pipeline and the State class, I implemented the pipeline registers and Pipelined Control mentioned in Chapter 4.7.\nHowever, the BNE and JAL instructions are not achievable with the Simple Implementation Scheme. So, compared to the single stage datapath from the textbook Figure 4.25, I made the following changes to complete the functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>added 2 control signals (ALUSrcA, JAL)</li>\n<li>added 1 MUX (ALU input A)</li>\n<li>added 2 gates (XOR, OR)</li>\n<li>modified a MUX (ALU input B)</li>\n<li>connected PC to a MUX(ALU input A) and instruction[12] to the XOR gate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Five Stage</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/iridiumtao/RISC-V-Simulator/blob/master/docs/Schematic%20RISCV%20Project%20Five%20Stage.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Schematic RISCV Project Five Stage.png\">\nModified from <a href=\"##Reference\">Textbook</a> Figure 4.62</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>In the Five-Stage machine, I added the forwarding unit and the hazard control unit to solve hazards introduced in the Mulit-stage pipeline. I kept the design of the control unit and PCSrc (from the result of 3 logic gates) and significantly modified other parts of the branch condition  by moving it from the EX stage to the ID stage. Additionally, I implemented a dedicated forwarding unit to handle branch decision input choices.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
