## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd iridium-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the portfolio. In this mode, the live editor will be available.

## 🔧 Building for Production

### Development Mode (with Live Editor)

To run the site locally with the live editor enabled, use:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Production Build (Static Export)

To generate the static files for deployment, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an `out` directory with static files ready for deployment. The editor is disabled in this build.

### Running a Local Production Server

To preview the production build locally, you can use a simple server after building:

```bash
yarn build
npx serve out # preview the production build locally
```

_Note: `yarn start` will not work with a static export. `serve` is a simple alternative for local testing._

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Blog Post Title"

   excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
   ---

   # Your Blog Content

   Write your blog content here using Markdown syntax.
   ```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to a GitHub Pages User site (e.g., `username.github.io`).

1. **Run the deploy script:**

   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

   This command will automatically build the static site and push the contents of the `out` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

2. **Configure GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup):**

   - For the source, select "Deploy from a branch".
   - Set the branch to `gh-pages` and the folder to `/ (root)`.
   - Save the settings.

Your site will be deployed and live after a few moments.

### Other Deployment Options

- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Deploy the `out` folder to Netlify
- **Static Hosting**: Upload the `out` folder to any static hosting service
