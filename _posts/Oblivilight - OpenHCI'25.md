Oblivilight is a human-computer interaction project designed to address the growing anxiety around AI data permanence. It functions as an intelligent night lamp that provides a safe, ephemeral space for users to voice their thoughts and emotions. By converting conversations into physical paper notes at the end of a session, it gives users tangible control over their personal data, turning the act of "forgetting" into a meaningful, physical ritual.

The project's innovative approach was recognized with the Best Demo Award at OpenHCI'25, where it was also the only project selected for presentation at the TAICHI'25 conference.


## Overview

As AI assistants become deeply integrated into our lives—assisting with everything from career planning to emotional companionship—they concurrently collect our data on an unprecedented scale. "Oblivilight" is a project that explores the critical intersection of this technological advancement with the human need for privacy and the "right to be forgotten" in the intelligent era. It manifests as an AI-powered, interactive sleep-aid lamp designed for intimate nighttime conversations. Instead of verbal replies, it responds with beautiful, dynamic visual art, translating the user's emotions into light. At the end of each session, the lamp prints a physical memento capturing the conversation's most dazzling visual moment, a brief summary, and an empathetic response. This process transforms memory into tangible objects that users can hold and control, thereby granting them complete agency over their data. The act of keeping or discarding the printed note transforms data deletion into a deliberate, therapeutic ritual of "letting go." Ultimately, the project addresses the fundamental need for a safe and private emotional outlet, allowing for vulnerability without creating a permanent digital footprint that could be misinterpreted or misused, offering a tangible and poetic solution to the challenges of data permanence in an increasingly digital world.


## Features

* **Voice-Activated Dialogue:** Users can initiate conversations naturally to share their thoughts and feelings before sleep. 
* **Real-time Emotion Visualization:** The lamp’s light shifts in color and intensity to reflect the emotional sentiment of the user's voice, providing empathetic, non-verbal feedback. 
* **Gesture-Based Deletion:** A simple wave of the hand over the lamp erases the current part of the conversation, offering immediate, intuitive control over the AI’s memory. 
* **Tangible Memory Creation:** At the end of a session (e.g., saying "Goodnight"), the lamp prints a physical "memory slip" containing a summary of the conversation, the date, and a visual of the emotional lightscape. 
* **Privacy-by-Design:** Once the memory is printed, it is wiped from the system, ensuring the user's thoughts remain private and under their physical control. 
* **Physical Memory Archive:** Users can choose to discard the printed notes or save them in a physical journal, creating a tangible collection of memories they can review offline. 


## Key Points


* Led a user-centric design process from research to prototype, identifying a key user need for tangible, privacy-preserving "forgetting mechanisms" in AI companions through 11 user interviews and secondary research.
* Architected a full-stack proof-of-concept integrating an LLM for conversation, emotion analysis, and a multi-modal interface with voice (Whisper/TTS) and gesture controls.
* Designed a novel interaction model that visualizes emotional sentiment as colored light and externalizes digital conversations into physical artifacts via a thermal printer, directly addressing AI data permanence anxiety.
