## Key Points
- **Loud Plants in Your Area** is an Augmented Reality (AR) application that helps combat "plant blindness" – the tendency to overlook plants as mere background décor. 
- It is designed for urban residents with limited exposure to nature, allowing them to perceive plants as living beings with feelings. 
- The app uses AR visualizations to reveal a plant’s **mood** or status in real time. 
- By capturing subtle signals or “sounds” from plants and interpreting them with AI, the app overlays engaging indicators and information on each plant through an AR view. 
- This way, users can **“hear” and see how plants feel**, encouraging empathy and a stronger human-plant connection.
